**`Full Stack Web Developer`**

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who loves building bespoke web applications. My latest app Job [Listings](https://github.com/carol100/job-listings) is developed using Laravel framework. It offers a platform for listing job opportunities. The app allows users to list new job opportunities and discover them. I'm currently developing [Eventstur](https://eventstur.com/) user portal, a customized application to help manage event ticketing, voting and conferences.
